Here's a **project description** you can use for your **Slide Controller Web App using MQTT**:

---

## **Slide Controller â€“ Remote Presentation Navigation via MQTT**

The **Slide Controller** is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows seamless remote navigation of PowerPoint slides over MQTT. Designed for presenters, educators, and conference speakers, the app enables slide control through a web interface that communicates with a local Python MQTT subscriber script which simulates keyboard events to control slide transitions.

### âœ… **Key Features**

* **Beautiful Responsive UI**: Built with modern CSS design principles using cards, shadows, and clean typography.
* **Next/Previous Buttons**: Interactive control buttons to navigate presentation slides.
* **Live Status Indicator**: A real-time indicator shows MQTT connection status using color-coded visual cues.
* **Device Toggle & Sensitivity Slider**: Optional settings for gesture/trigger sensitivity (useful if extended for motion control).
* **Cross-Platform Web Access**: Works on desktop, tablets, and mobile browsers.
* **Integration Ready**: Easily extendable with gesture control, mobile sensors, or voice input.

### ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

* The **Flask web app (hosted on Glitch)** acts as the **MQTT publisher**.
* The **Python script** on the local machine subscribes to MQTT topics and uses `pyautogui` to simulate keypresses (left/right arrows) for PowerPoint control.
* MQTT acts as the bridge between the remote web interface and the local machine running the presentation.

### ðŸ§ª **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Python (Flask), MQTT
* **MQTT Broker**: Public broker (e.g., `HiveMQ Cloud`) or local broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
* **Automation**: `pyautogui` for simulating key presses

### ðŸ“¦ **Project Structure**

* `index.html` â€“ Frontend interface for controlling slides
* `server.py` â€“ Flask app to serve frontend and publish MQTT messages
* `subscriber.py` â€“ Python MQTT client that receives commands and simulates keyboard input (run in host machine)

### ðŸš€ **Deployment**

* Flask app is deployed on **Glitch** for easy access and control from any device.
* Local subscriber script is run on the presentation computer, connected to the same MQTT broker.
