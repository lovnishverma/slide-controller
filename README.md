## 💡 Why Slide Controller is Revolutionary?

1️⃣ **No Hardware Required**  
   - Forget physical presenters. Use **any internet-connected device** as your remote control. Works on **mobile, tablet, or desktop browsers**.

2️⃣ **MQTT-Powered Connectivity**  
   - Leverages **MQTT**, the industry-standard IoT protocol, for **real-time, low-latency slide transitions**. Unlike traditional remotes, it’s **extendable** to integrate with IoT devices, voice assistants, or even custom hardware.

3️⃣ **Motion & Gesture Control**  
   - **Shake your device** to skip slides or adjust sensitivity via a built-in slider. No need to press buttons—your movements become commands!

4️⃣ **Haptic Feedback**  
   - Feel vibrations on your device when slides change, ensuring you’re always in sync with your presentation.

5️⃣ **Cross-Platform & Open-Source**  
   - Fully customizable codebase. Tweak UI/UX, add new features (like voice commands or gesture recognition), or integrate it with smart devices—**the possibilities are endless**!

6️⃣ **Dark Mode & Responsive Design**  
   - A sleek, **modern UI** with toggleable dark mode and pixel-perfect responsiveness for **every screen size**.

7️⃣ **Tkinter GUI Enhancements (v2.0)**  
   - Easily configurable MQTT settings  
   - Visual feedback for connection status  
   - Support for saving preferences locally using config files  
   - User-friendly theme switching and window management  

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- **Web Interface**: Hosted on platforms like **Glitch**, the frontend provides intuitive controls.
- **MQTT Broker**: Uses **HiveMQ Cloud** or local brokers (like Mosquitto) for reliable communication.
- **Local Automation**: A Python script listens to MQTT messages and uses **`pyautogui`** to simulate keyboard inputs, controlling PowerPoint or any presentation software directly.
- **Subscriber v2.0**: Now comes with a Tkinter GUI to configure:
  - MQTT Broker
  - Port
  - Username
  - Password
  - Topic
  - Themes (Light, Dark, High Contrast)
  - Window always-on-top toggle

## 🌐 Set Up MQTT Broker

### ✅ Option 1: HiveMQ Cloud (Recommended)
> HiveMQ Cloud is free, secure, reliable, and requires no local setup.

#### Step-by-Step: Create a HiveMQ Cloud Broker
1. Go to [HiveMQ Cloud Console](https://console.hivemq.cloud/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new cluster (Free Tier)
4. Note the Broker Hostname and Port (8883 for TLS)
5. Create MQTT Credentials (Username & Password)
6. Enable TLS/SSL

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/472547c9-3e3b-456b-bea4-a5db7bd801c5)


Example Code:
```python
BROKER = "your-cluster-id.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud"
PORT = 8883
USERNAME = "slideuser"
PASSWORD = "myslidesecret"
TOPIC = "slide/control"

client.tls_set()
client.username_pw_set(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
client.connect(BROKER, PORT)
```

### ✅ Option 2: Local Mosquitto Broker (Advanced Users Only)

Install on Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
mosquitto
```

Set in scripts:
```python
BROKER = "localhost"
PORT = 1883
```

## 📝 Notes

- The Tkinter GUI saves MQTT settings in a `config.ini` file for persistent configuration.
- Users can now edit MQTT credentials without touching the code.
- Themes are stored in a separate JSON file for easy expansion.
- The GUI supports resizing, minimizing, and staying on top of other windows.
- Ensure the `subscriber.exe` is running with proper screen access and focus on the presentation app (e.g., PowerPoint).

---

## 🧪 Test It Out

1. Open your Flask web app in a browser.
2. Click "Next" or "Previous" buttons.
3. On the presentation computer, ensure `subscriber_version-2.0.exe` is running and PowerPoint is focused.
4. Slide transitions should occur instantly.
5. You can now modify MQTT settings and switch themes on the fly.
